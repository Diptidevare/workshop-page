            We conducted an engaging ROS Workshop that provided hands-on
            experience with the Robot Operating System (ROS), guiding
            participants through the setup of a Virtual Machine (VM) and ROS
            installation. The workshop covered key concepts like ROS nodes,
            publishers and subscribers, and talker-listener applications for
            node communication. Participants also explored Turtlesim for
            visualizing robot movement, learned about ROS topics, and used RViz
            for 3D visualization of robot states and sensor data. The session
            concluded with a practical exploration of the E-Yantra robot on
            Gazebo, simulating real-world robot tasks in a virtual environment.
            By the end, attendees were equipped with essential ROS skills to
